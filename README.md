# Add Two Numbers – Algorithm Visualization

This is a simple web-based visualization tool for the classic algorithm **"Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists"**, inspired by a popular LeetCode problem. It simulates how two numbers are added digit-by-digit (in reverse order), demonstrating how the algorithm works step-by-step.

## 📸 Demo Preview

> Enter two numbers, press **Setup**, and step through or autoplay the algorithm to see how linked lists simulate the addition process.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Input two numbers as strings of digits (e.g., 342 and 465).
- 🔁 Converts them into linked lists in reverse order.
- 🧠 Steps through the addition algorithm, visualizing:
  - Current digits
  - Carry
  - Result list building
- 🎬 Auto Play, Step-by-step control, Reset
