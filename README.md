# Add Two Numbers – Algorithm Visualization

This is a simple web-based visualization tool for the classic algorithm **"Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists"**, inspired by a popular LeetCode problem. It simulates how two numbers are added digit-by-digit (in reverse order), demonstrating how the algorithm works step-by-step.

## 📸 Demo Preview

> Enter two numbers, press **Setup**, and step through or autoplay the algorithm to see how linked lists simulate the addition process.
